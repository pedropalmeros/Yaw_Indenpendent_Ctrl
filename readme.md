In this folder the next goals have been achieved.
-> Position is controlled by the Backstepping procedure, although it worked
with Euler Angles
-> The full attitude is controlled by Backstepping in quaternions.

----------------------------
Missing 
-> Compute the position control with the vectorial perspective, this is needed
in order to compute the desired attitude and send it to the quaternion attitude
controller. 
-> Extract the desired attitude from the position controller
